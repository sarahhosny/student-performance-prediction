# student-performance-prediction
This project uses the Student Performance Factors dataset to predict studentsâ€™ exam scores based on study hours. After performing data cleaning and visualization, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is then trained, and its predictions are evaluated and visualized to measure performance.
